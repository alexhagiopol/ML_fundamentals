## Machine Learning Fundamentals 

### Intro:

This repo contains my Matlab / Octave implementations of the projects in [Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I strive to write the most efficient solutions possible for each project. If you know a better solution please submit a PR.

### Contents:

To maintain as much consistency with the course as possible, I retain all of the original filenames from the course material. This practice makes the repo a bit hard to navigate, so here are the topics covered and where to find them: 

	Linear Regression   - machine-learning-ex1
	Logistic Regression - machine-learning-ex2

### Notices:

1. All content in this repo aside from the implementations themselves is created by Coursera; I only use this GitHub repo to maintain the history of my work in an easy to find place. 
2. There are so many places where the solutions to this course are posted on the Internet, that I didn't feel the need to pay for a private repo. 
3. I warn current Coursera students that copying these or any other solutions is against the honor code you agreed to when signing up for the course :innocent:.
